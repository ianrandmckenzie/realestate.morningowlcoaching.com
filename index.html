				<h2>Explore</h2>
				<p>“I have worked with Leesa both in group coaching and individual coaching environments. 
					Both have been extremely beneficial to my professional and personal development. 
					Regarding the one on one coaching with Leesa I felt heard. Leesa’s questions really 
					provoked a lot of deep thought and understanding of myself. My intent with coaching 
					was to explore options to grow my business. The coaching became so much more, including, 
					but not limited to, when I grow how will I manage the growth, what is my end-game/exit 
					strategy and what am I really looking for in the next ten years.”<br>
					C. Worthy. MBA, REALTOR

			<div class="col-lg-3 block">
				<h2>Partner</h2>
				<p>“Leesa is an enthusiastic, knowledgeable and authentic leader. I have had the pleasure 
					of attending small group coaching sessions hosted by Leesa in addition to working 
					side-by-side with joint clients in their search for and/or sale of a home. Leesa is a 
					fantastic communicator and natural leader who brings out the best in those around her. 
					Her training and mentoring of others is some of the best I have personally experienced 
					and/or seen in my 13 years in Real Estate. Leesa has been instrumental in my professional 
					growth which directly led to obtaining my managing broker’s license. Thank you Leesa! As a 
					Coach, Leesa’s attention to detail and client centric service is second to none.”<br>

				<h2>Motivate</h2>
				<p>“I felt I connected with Leesa immediately. It’s not that I don’t work hard. It’s not that 
					I don’t know my goals. What Leesa brought to me was the challenge to step out of my comfort 
					zone and try new approaches and directions with my business. I ended up crossing lines that 
					I had created for myself in my past practices, and found the outcome was surprising and rewarding. 
					It motivated me to make more changes and try new things. It’s nice to have Leesa to check in with 
					during the process and outcome. Co-workers told me they could see the difference and that they liked it, 
					that was a special moment for me. “<br>

					<h2>Don’t Let Your Insecurities Cost You</h2>
					<p>We know “the business” of real estate is expensive. There are fees, licenses and many other costs 
						just for the privilege of calling yourself a Realtor. When you’re not making sales, when you’re 
						unable to create the relationships you need to get clients to trust you, the income stops. But 
						the monthly bills don’t. Take control of your business, of your inner critic and recognize the greatness you hold.</p>

					<h2>Build Clarity & Human Connection</h2>
					<p>When you're paralyzed by self-limiting beliefs, when YOU don’t even believe in you, there is no chance you will create 
						the real estate business you want. You create a false bravado - a “fake it until you make it” - mentality that blocks your ability to connect or build trust with others.<br><br>

						But you CAN gain the power to kick those obstructions to the curb; to discover what you value, to understand where you want to go and 
						develop an action plan to get there. You build the confidence and strength to direct your own success.
